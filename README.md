# Approach Followed

## Step 1: Organizing the Data

- **Control Group Compilation:** We collected data from healthy individuals' brain cells pooling this information into a unified dataset known as an AnnData object.
- **Disease Group Compilation:** Similarly, we gathered data from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's amalgamating this into another AnnData object.

## Step 2: Integrating Data for Comparative Analysis

- **Merging Datasets:** The next critical step involved combining the control and disease group datasets into one integrated AnnData object.

## Step 3: Identifying Genetic Discrepancies

- **Differential Gene Expression Analysis:** With a comprehensive dataset at our disposal, we conducted an analysis to discern genes that were either upregulated or downregulated in Alzheimer's affected brain cells compared to healthy ones.

# Preparing Your Dataset

## Data Collection and Initial Setup

- **Rationale:** Start with high-quality scRNA-seq data from various brain regions.
